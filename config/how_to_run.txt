This directory contains files that support source modification on a PC
such as a Windows or Unix box, and quick deployment and testing on an EW
tablet. Since our file locations are rapidly evolving, it is likely that
the scripts have become stale and might require modification. This content
was written for a Windows environment, so the shell scripts (.cmd files)
will have to be ported to use on a Unix box.

This file describes how to run the rudimentary launcher and SDK plumbing
tests within...

Create a /data/guest directory on the tablet
--------------------------------------------
We need a place on the tablet to conveniently keep files that are not in
a read-only file system and that are not deleted at reboot. I created
a directory /data/guest and made it owned by user "guest". Once done,
this directory and its contents will live on forever. Then, create a
subdirectory /data/guest/ew_python.

Copy files to tablet
--------------------
The script "bin/send.cmd" uses zip to create archive files and scp to
copy those files to tablet directory /data/guest/ew_python. Note that
the send.cmd script uses the "pscp" command, which is part of the "putty"
family. It is just like "scp", so if you have "scp" and not "pscp", modify
the command name in the script. If you have neither, find another way to
copy the ZIP files to /data/guest/ew_python on the tablet.

Start up processes on tablet
----------------------------
After reboot of our tablet, the old-generation software is running.
Execute these commands (aliases):
  killds  # kill the old display server daemon
  killnb  # kill the notebook daemon
  killshasta  # kill a pesky daemon the prevents the new DS from starting
If your tablet does not have a killshasta alias, here is the command to
create it:
  alias killshasta='sudo pkill -f "/bin/cat /dev/shasta"'

I usually work with 2 ssh windows talking to the tablet, one to run the
display server and another to run the launcher. In both shells it is
handy to run as superuser, which I do by running the commands:

  sudo bash
  cd /data/guest/ew_python

After running send.cmd to copy the new zip files to the tablet, run the
deployment script:

  sh unzipit.sh

In the display server shell window, start the new DS, which will run
indefinitely:

  bin/ds.sh

In the launcher shell window, run the launcher:

  sh unzipit.sh && ./start_launcher.sh foreground

To kill the launcher, in the launcher's window enter:

  ^Z
  kill %1  # Works so long as there are no other background processes
           # started by this shell.
